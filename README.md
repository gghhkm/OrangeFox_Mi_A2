# OrangeFox For your Device

Hello Everyone !!!
_______________________________________
Welcome to my OrangeFox Repo

Here you can use my Script to create OrangeFox Recovery for your Device very easily.

Now you can automate the compile processes, just clone this to ~/OrangeFox-Universal-Compile-Tool/ , add a config file for your device, run this script and as long as everything is good (e.g. The Config File and Device Tree); Compile OrangeFox Recovery 🦊
